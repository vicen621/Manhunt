## Useful information
* In the case of being several runners, hunters can change who tracks their compass, this is possible by clicking left with the compass in main hand
* Hunters don't drop the compass when they die and are given one when they respawn, nor can they throw it out of their inventory.
* If the runner and the hunter are in different worlds, the compass will mark the position of the portal through which the runner passed.
* The compass does not work in the end
